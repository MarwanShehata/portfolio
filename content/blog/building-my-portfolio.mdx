Building a personal website... the ultimate developer flex. I could have used a template, but where is the fun in that? Instead, I built this site from scratch to showcase my skills.

  This portfolio is built with some of my favorite technologies. I wanted something fast, modern, and easy to maintain.

Here is the full breakdown of the `Stack`:

<Stack/>

The entire codebase is structured to be clean and scalable. I used Next.js App Router for routing and server components for performance. All content is written in MDX, which allows me to use React components directly in my markdown files.

The result is a site that is not only a portfolio of my work but also a demonstration of my abilities.
