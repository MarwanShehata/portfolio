I'm a Frontend Web Developer with a background in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in React and Next.js. I'm skilled in developing e-commerce platforms and complex web applications, and I'm passionate about creating efficient, user-friendly solutions and continuously expanding my technical expertise.

I'm currently a Junior Frontend Web Developer at Euclid, where I've developed a B2B e-commerce platform with over 10,000 products, implementing authentication, product management, and payment integrations. I've also built and optimized UI components using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and React Query, ensuring an intuitive and high-performing user experience.

I maintain a small mailing list where I share infrequent updates on my projects and what's new. Join if you're interested!

I'm most active on [X](https://x.com/Mrwan_Shehata) and [GitHub](https://github.com/MarwanShehata) if you want to chat or see what I'm up to.
